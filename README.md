# Medley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley)

Medley is a lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library of useful, pure
functions that are "missing" from clojure.core.

Unlike [flatland/useful][1], Medley does not attempt to be
comprehensive, and unlike [Prismatic/plumbing][2], Medley limits
itself to pure functions with very general use-cases.
