# Medley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley)

Medley is a lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library of useful,
*mostly* pure functions that are "missing" from clojure.core.

Medley has a tighter focus than [flatland/useful][1] and
[Prismatic/plumbing][2], and limits itself to a small set of
general-purpose functions.
