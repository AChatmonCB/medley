# Medley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley)

Medley is a lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library of useful,
*mostly* pure functions that are "missing" from clojure.core.

Medley has a tighter focus than [flatland/useful][1] and
[Prismatic/plumbing][2], and limits itself to a small set of
general-purpose functions.

## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:

    [medley "0.6.0"]

## Breaking Changes

In 0.6.0 the type signature of `greatest` and `least` was changed to be more
like `max` and `min` in Clojure core. If you're upgrading from a version prior
to 0.6.0, please update your usage of `greatest` and `least`.
