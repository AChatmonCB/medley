# Medley

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weavejester/medley)

Medley is a lightweight Clojure library of useful functions that are
"missing" from clojure.core.

Unlike [flatland/useful][1], Medley does not attempt to be
comprehensive, and limits itself pure functions that would not seem
out of place in the core Clojure library.
