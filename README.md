# Medley

Medley is a lightweight Clojure library of useful functions that are
"missing" from clojure.core.

Unlike [flatland/useful][1], Medley does not attempt to be
comprehensive, and limits itself pure functions that would not seem
out of place in the core Clojure library.

## Installation

To install, add the following to your project `:dependencies`:
